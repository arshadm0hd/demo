**CloudFormation Template Overview:**

This set of CloudFormation templates facilitates the creation of two distinct Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) with unique CIDR blocks. Additionally, it establishes a VPC peering connection to interconnect these VPCs. Another CloudFormation template is responsible for setting up a Client VPN endpoint to enable secure communication with servers in the private network of one of the VPCs, referred to as "sharedsystem."

A Serverless Aurora MySQL database is also provisioned through the second CloudFormation template.

**Parameters:**

In the first template, network range parameters are specified, utilizing the network class as the input value. CIDR blocks are defined within the template based on these parameters. The second template requires parameters such as DB name, master username, client and server certificates (imported from the local machine to AWS Certificate Manager), client VPN configuration details including client CIDR block and target network, Aurora capacity, Secret Manager details for securely storing DB credentials, and the threshold time for inactive DB instances.

**Resources:**

The first CloudFormation template creates two VPCs with distinct CIDR blocks, a VPC peering connection, security groups, an internet gateway, NAT gateway, route tables, and subnets (both private and public).

The second CloudFormation template provisions a VPN client, Serverless Aurora MySQL database, private DB subnet group, RDS security group (permitting only port 3306), and Secret Manager for secure storage of DB credentials.

Outputs from the first template, such as VPC ID and subnets, are utilized in the second template, forming dependencies between resources. Note that the VPC security group currently allows all traffic; refining these rules according to specific application requirements is recommended for production use.

**Demonstration Scenario:**

For demonstration purposes, an EC2 instance is instantiated within the "sharedsystem" network in the private subnet. This instance is accessed via a VPN client configured on the local machine, allowing interaction with the database hosted in the second VPC.
